- Develop a Neural Network model with the purpose of distinguishing whether a patient exhibits the presence of a brain tumor or not by analyzing brain MRI scans.
- Developed 3 Deep Neural Network models i.e. DenseNet(Densely Connected Convolutional Networks), ReseNet50,Xception in order to classify the Brain MRI Images to 4 different independent classes.
-
- Obtained the MRI dataset from kaggle
