## Problem Statement:

- Given a dataset encompassing known brain tumor diagnoses, it is feasible to develope and implement an image-based classifier proficient in autonomously identifying brain tumors and potential anomalies.
- Source of data [Brain Tumor](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) 

## Motivation and Goals:

The primary drive behind this application is to provide valuable support to neurosurgeons and radiologists by offering a cost-effective and non-invasive means of brain tumor detection. The key objectives of this project are:


1. Develop a classification model to automatically identify MRI Brain images that exhibit the presence of tumors and distinguish them from those without tumors, aided by their respective mask images.

2. Implement a segmentation process on MRI images to accurately separate tumor regions from normal brain tissues.

##
- Develop a Neural Network model aimed at the classification of whether a patient has a brain tumor or not based on the analysis of brain MRI scans.

- Developed 3 Deep Neural Network models i.e. MobileNet,Xception,ReseNet50 in order to classify the Brain MRI Images to 4 different independent classes.
  
- Statistical metrics was used to evaluate model peformance.
  
- See the Metrics in a table below: Accuracy,F1-score, MAE, MSE, RMSE
