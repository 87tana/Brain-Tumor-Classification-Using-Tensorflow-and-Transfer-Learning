## Introduction:

This project employs **deep learning** to classify brain tumors in MRI scans, emphasizing a comparative analysis of  various **transfer learning** approaches.
Three distinct deep neural network models, namely **MobileNet, Xception, and ResNet50 models**, we categorize brain tumors into four classes: No Tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary.
These models predict the presence of a brain tumor based on MRI scans, and their comparative analysis offers insights into their performance for brain tumor classification.

## What is brain tumor?

A brain tumor refers to an accumulation of abnormal cells in the brain, presenting a significant health concern due to its aggressive nature. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) stands out as the most effective technique for detecting brain tumors.

## Motivation and Goals:

Provide valuable support to neurosurgeons and radiologists by offering a cost-effective and non-invasive means of brain tumor detection. The key objectives of this project are:

1. Develop a classification model to automatically identify MRI Brain images that exhibit the presence of tumors and distinguish them from those without tumors, aided by their respective mask images.

2. Implement a segmentation process on MRI images to accurately separate tumor regions from normal brain tissues.

##
- Develop a Neural Network model aimed at the classification of whether a patient has a brain tumor or not based on the analysis of brain MRI scans.

- Developed 3 Deep Neural Network models i.e. MobileNet,Xception,ReseNet50 in order to classify the Brain MRI Images to 4 different independent classes.
  
- Statistical metrics was used to evaluate model peformance.
  
- See the Metrics in a table below: Accuracy,F1-score, MAE, MSE, RMSE
